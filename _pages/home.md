### tl;dr

I am currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer @ [Malaa Technologies](https://malaa.tech).

If you want to get updates for when I publish new content, please subscribe to my newsletters:
- [ma7dev Newsletter](https://ma7dev.substack.com) is where I share Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and any related topics.
- [ma7xyz Newsletter](https://ma7xyz.substack.com) is where I share life, experience, thoughts, learning, and other random topics from my personal experience.

In my free time, I like to spend my time working out at the gym, or learning new things about AI, reasoning, philosophy, or software engineering.
