### tl;dr

I am currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer @ [Malaa Technologies](https://malaa.tech).

Check [my blogs](/blog/) where different kinds of content:
- Technical content: Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and any related topics.
- Personal content: Life, experience, thoughts, learning, and other random topics from my personal experience.

In my free time, I like to spend my time working out at the gym, or learning new things about AI, reasoning, philosophy, or software engineering.
