Each thread includes a unique program counter, process stack, and set of processor registers. The kernel schedules individual threads, not processes. In traditional Unix systems, each process consists of one thread. In modern systems, however, multi-threaded programs consist of more than one thread are common <sup id="fnref:f1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="freebsd">FreeBSD</h3> <p>A process is a program in execution. Each process has an address space containing a mapping of its program’s object code and global variables, a set of kernel resources that it can name and on which it can operate using system calls, and at least one and possibly many threads that execute its code. Every process in the system is assigned a unique identifier termed the process identifier (PID). An PID is a common mechanism used by applications and by the kernel to reference processes and it is used by applications when the latter send a signal to a process and when receiving the exit status from a deceased process. There are two PIDs that are special important to to each process: the PID of the process itself and the PID of the process’s parent process. A process structure contains information that must always remain resident in main memory, along with references to other structures that remain resident <sup id="fnref:f4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>Every thread represents a virtual processor with a full context worth of register state and its own stack mapped into the address space. In addition, every thread running in the process has a corresponding kernel thread, with its own kernel stack that represents the user thread when it is executing in the kernel as a result of a system call, page fault, or signal delivery. The threads of a process operate in either user mode or kernel mode. In user mode, a thread executes application code with the machine in a non-privileged protection mode. Thread structure tracks information that needs to be resident only when the process is executing such as its kernel run-time stack. Both, process and thread, structures are allocated dynamically as part of process creation and are freed when the process is destroyed as it exits <sup id="fnref:f4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>The FreeBSD timeshare scheduler uses a priority-based scheduling policy that is biased to favor interactive programs, such as text editors, over long-running batch-type jobs. Interactive programs tend to exhibit short bursts of computation followed by periods of inactivity or I/O. The scheduling policy initially assigns a high execution priority to each thread and allows that thread to execute for a fixed time slice <sup id="fnref:f4:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3> <p>A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion. Each process is uniquely identified by a number called a <em>process ID</em> (PID). Similar to files, each process has one owner and group, and the owner and group permissions are used to determine which files and devices the process can open <sup id="fnref:f5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p> <p>In addition, to create a process in Windows, we will need to use CreateProcess function.

Different programs expect various levels of structure, but the kernel doesn’t impose structure on I/O. In addition, UNIX processes use a descriptor to reference I/O streams. Descriptors are small unsigned integers obtained from the open and socket system calls. Read and write system calls can be applied to descriptors to transfer data, and close system call can be used to dead-locate any descriptor. There are three types of descriptors, files, pipes, and sockets. Files are linear array bytes, has at least one name, exists until all its names are deleted explicitly, and no process holds a descriptor for it. Pipes are a linear array of bytes, no name, used as an I/O stream, it is unidirectional, and created by a pipe system call. Sockets are transient objects, used for interprocess communication, exists only as long as some process holds a descriptor referring to it, and created by a socket system call. Furthermore, hardware devices can be categorized as either block (structure) or character (unstructured). For block devices, they are typified by disks and magnetic tapes, the kernel supports read-modify-write-type buffering actions on block-oriented structured devices to allow latter to be read and written in a totally random byte addressed fashion, and the filesystems are created on block devices. For character devices, they are communication lines, raster plotters, and unbuffered magnetic tapes and disks, and are support large block I/O transfers <sup id="fnref:f7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p> <p>For previous editions of stream I/O system, the stream I/O system was based on the UNIX character I/O system, which allows a user process to open a way terminal port and then to insert appropriated kernel-processing modules and the modules that are being processed by the network protocols can be inserted in the appreciated kernel-processing modules. In addition, stacking a terminal-processing module on top of a network-processing module allowed flexible and efficient implementation of the network viral terminals within the kernel. In newer editions of stream I/O system ,such as 18th edition which was adopted in System V. However, the design of the networking facilities for 4.2BSD changed its approach based on the socket interface and flexible multi-player network architecture, which allows a single system to support multiple sets of networking protocols with stream, datagram, and other types of access. In addition, the user application and the kernel operate independently of each other for security. In 4.4BSD, the kernel doesn’t store I/O control blocks or other operating-system-related data structures in the application address space. Each user-level application is provided with an independent address space in which it executes its applications/processes. Moreover, the kernel makes most of the state changes invisible to the processes involved <sup id="fnref:f7:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p> <p>FreeBSD supports two different disk encryption methods, GBDE and GELI, and both of the methods support different cryptographic algorithms that counter different threats. For GBDE, it is high-security (protecting the user as protecting the data), cryptographic key provided by the user, and when the key is lost, the data can’t be accessed. On the other hand, GELI protects the data but doesn’t protect the user, it uses FreeBSD’s cryptographic device driver, and takes advantage of its transparently <sup id="fnref:f8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p> <h3 id="windows-1">Windows</h3> <p>The design goals for the Windows I/O system are to provide an abstraction of devices, both hardware and software to application with a selected features of the operating system, such as uniform security, high-performance asynchronous, high-level language support, etc. Windows I/O system is responsible for the connection between user model functionality, storage, and drivers with WDM WMI Routines, PnP Manager, Power Manager, and I/O Manager. For I/O Manager, it is the core of the Windows I/O system because it defines the order of the framework within which I/O requests are delivered to device drivers. Most I/O requests are represented as I/O Request Packet (IRP), which travels from one I/O system component to another. The design of Windows I/O system allows an individual application thread to manage multiple I/O requests concurrently <sup id="fnref:f9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p> <p>Moreover, I have found 4 interesting algorithms built within the driver structure, Initialization Routine, Opening Devices, IRP, and Completing an I/O Request. For the Initialization Routine, the I/O manager executes a driver’s Initialization Routine when it loads the driver into the operating system. Then, the Initialization Routine fills in the system data structures to register the rest of the driver’s routines with the I/O manager and performs any global driver initialization that is necessary. For the Opening Devices, a file object is in a kernel model data structure that represents a handle to a device, and this process allows synchronization and easy manipulation of the object files. For IRP, the IRP is where the I/O system stores information it needs to process an I/O request, so when a thread calls an I/O API, the I/O manager constructs an IRP to represent the operation as it progresses through the I/O system. For Completing an I/O Request, it starts when a driver calls IoCompleteRequest to inform the I/O manager that has completed process teh request specified in the IRP <sup id="fnref:f9:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p> <p>I have found a good example<sup id="fnref:f10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> of how to use IoCompleteRequest in a Windows machine to implement Completing an I/O Request.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NTSTATUS CompleteRequest<span class="o">(</span>PIRP Irp, NTSTATUS status, ULONG_PTR Information<span class="o">)</span>

However, FreeBSD has higher security than Linux beucase FreeBSD requires third parties verification of the system compared to Linux, which can accepts updates from anyone with minor verification.

For the text segment, it is read-only, has initialized and uninitialized data portions of a program, and, in most machines, a process can change the size of its text segment only when the segment’s contents are overlaid with data from the files system or when debugging in action. For the stack, it has application’s run-time stack and makes a system call in most machines. Lastly, initial contents of the segments of a child process are duplicated from the segments of a parent process. Moreover, for memory management inside the kernel, kernel often does allocation of memory that are needed for only the duration of a single system call, but in a user process, such as short-term memory, would be allocated on the run-time stack. Kernel’s memory isn’t feasible to allocate even moderate-sized blocks of memory on it because the kernel has a limited run-time stack <sup id="fnref:f7:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p> <p>For memory management, kernel can’t easily deal with memory allocation errors and often can’t scheme. Therefore, getting the memory in the kernel is more complicated than in user-space. Moreover, kernel treats phsical pages as the basic unit of memory management and kernel represents every phsical page on the system with a struct page structure, which is defined in &lt;linux/mm_types.h&gt; <sup id="fnref:f1:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="p">{</span>

Non-paged pool and paged pool are located in the region of the address space that is reserved for the system and mapped into the virtual address space of each process. For the non-paged pool, it consists of virtual memory addresses that are guaranteed to reside in physical memory as long as the corresponding kernel objects are allocated.
